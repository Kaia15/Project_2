                    <p> Birthdays are important because they give everyone a day to feel special and 
                        see how much those around them love them. Many cultures say that your birthday 
                        is more than just a special day of the year. Horoscopes are based on the position 
                        of the stars and planets at your time of birth and many people believe that your 
                        horoscope can tell you a great deal about your personality and fate. Based on your 
                        birth year you are also assigned an animal from the Chinese zodiac, a lunar calendar.
                        Many cultures celebrate birthdays with fun traditions that help bind families and cultures 
                        together as everyone participates in the festivities. In the United States it’s appropriate
                        to wish someone a happy birthday by sending them a text, calling them, sending a card by mail, or giving them a gift.</p>
